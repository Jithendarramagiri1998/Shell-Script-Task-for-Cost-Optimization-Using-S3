# Shell Script Task for Cost Optimization Using S3  

## Objective  
Optimize the cost of storing and managing logs by replacing ELK stack storage with Amazon S3 for backup and long-term storage. This approach reduces storage costs and automates the log backup process using Jenkins, shell scripting, and AWS S3 lifecycle management.  

---

## Proposed Solution  

1. **Transition from ELK to S3 for Logs Storage**  
   - Instead of using ELK for log storage and backup, utilize Amazon S3, which offers significantly lower costs.  
   - ELK can still be used for analysis, but logs no longer need to be retained in ELK beyond the analysis stage.  

2. **Automation of Log Backup to S3**  
   - Automate the daily log backup process using a shell script integrated with **Jenkins** and scheduled via **cron jobs**.  
   - Store logs in an S3 bucket designated for backup and archival purposes.  

3. **Leverage S3 Lifecycle Policies**  
   - Define lifecycle policies to manage logs efficiently:  
     - Move infrequently accessed logs to **S3 Glacier** or **S3 Deep Archive** for cost-effective storage.  
     - Automatically delete logs after a predefined retention period (e.g., 90 or 180 days).  

4. **Daily Log Backup Process**  
   - Create a shell script to:  
     - Compress log files.  
     - Upload the compressed files to the specified S3 bucket.  
   - Configure a cron job to execute this script every night.  

5. **Jenkins Integration**  
   - Use Jenkins to trigger the shell script for log upload and monitoring.  
   - Replace email notifications with an automated log archival system, eliminating unnecessary communication overhead.

## Benefits  

- **Cost Optimization**: Reduced costs by transitioning from ELK storage to S3 for logs backup.  
- **Automation**: Eliminates manual tasks using Jenkins and shell scripting.  
- **Efficient Storage Management**: S3 lifecycle rules ensure cost-effective retention of logs in Glacier or Deep Archive.  
- **Scalability**: S3 can handle log data growth without additional infrastructure changes.
